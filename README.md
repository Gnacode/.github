 GNACODE's Public Repository Overview

We develop software for our microcontrollers for our instruments, and we develop tools for data analysis that is based on output from our devices, lab environment, and calibration systems. Some of these tools can be used as standalone programs, and we publish them here.

Hereto, we also publish our most interesting application in scientific journals and host the public repositories for those publications here as well
